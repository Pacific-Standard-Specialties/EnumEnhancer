# Contributing to this repository

Contributions, comments, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome.

Please stick to the same style as existing code as much as possible, which largely follows Microsoft's published style guides for C#, before submitting pull requests.

If you do not have Rider or ReSharper (which is what I'm using for formatting), you can use JetBrains' code formatting/cleanup tool for free. It is available [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/CleanupCode.html), to reformat your code using the rulesets from this repository, before submitting a PR for review.
